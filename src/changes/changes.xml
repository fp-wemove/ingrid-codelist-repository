                Initial version of the Codelist Repository. This webapp contains an administration interface for all central
                managed Codelists. Codelists can be added, deleted and modified. For each Codelist several entries can be added
                in different languages (also ISO). With a REST-Interface the codelists can be fetched. If called with a timestamp
                then only updated Codelists are returned.
